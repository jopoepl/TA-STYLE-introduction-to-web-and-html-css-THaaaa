  <p class="paragraph">
   HTML and CSS determine the structure and style of a webpage, respectively. HTML & CSS are often confused as programming languages but one has to be clear that they are not. They do not follow logic or conditions, both of which are essential to a programming language. 
  </p>
  <p class="paragraph">
    Elements are the building blocks of HTML. Attributes add more information about elements. You can also add CSS elements inside an HTML tag. Or you can create an external stylesheet to add CSS styling to the elements on a webpage.
